# cashless-society
idea with a simple distributed ledger wallets and everyone can participate in a peer-based bank

## ideas

- choose public and private wallet
  - public wallets - everyone can borrow from if you accept it, and every transaction is recorded in a public manner. 
  - private wallet is your mini-bank, you can't transact / buy money but you can transfer to other public wallet
  
- group wallets - a public wallet intended for saving up for a group (friends/family/colleagues/business partners)
